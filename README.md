# Stochastic-Simulation-of-Reaction-Networks

A notebook written in Julia for stochastic simulation of a reaction network. Contains the following:

- Gillespie Algorithm to simulate individual trajectories of a reaction network
- Finite State Projection for finding the probability distribution at a time $t$
- MCMC metropolis hastings algorithm to find the posterior distribution of the reaction kinetics given the data and hypothesized reaction network
